**Beta version of the Polytype keyboard layout: (1.0-beta)**

`1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  -  =`
`q  w  t  u  f  h  p  y  j  ;  [  ]`
`a  s  d  r  g  l  n  e  i  o  '`
`z  x  c  v  b  k  m  ,  .  /`

**Beta Version Notes:**

1.  The 'th' combination places two letters on the upper row, which is a bit of a stretch.
2.  The 'st' combination puts two letters on adjacent diagonals, which is a bit of a stretch.
3.  The letter 'g' isn't used in many combinations, both in Spanish and English, but takes up space on the home row.
4.  The letter 'l' is excellent in the home row for Spanish and satisfactory for English.

**THE OPTIMAL LAYOUT (Polytype 1.0):**

`1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  -  =`
`q  w  h  p  f  y  u  g  j  ;  [  ]`
`a  s  d  t  l  r  n  e  i  o  '`
`z  x  c  v  b  k  m  ,  .  /`

**Notes (for Spanish vocables):**

1.  Regarding the **'mu'** combination and its derivatives: There might be some issues when typing the following words:

- _Muy_ (all three letters are pressed with the same finger),
- _Mundo_ (mun are also with the same finger),
- _Muriendo_ (mur are with the same finger),
- _NÃºmero_ (num are with the same finger, and all the keys are on the right hand).

* Note about the word **'muy'**: The issue of typing the word 'muy' with the same finger also exists in QWERTY. These keys ('m', 'u', 'y') were not changed for the Polytype layout.

2.  Regarding the **'bl'** combination and its derivatives:

    So far, the only word that has caused me a problem is the word _'problema.'_ The issue is not very significant, but this combination 'bl' is typed with the same finger (left index finger) in the extended middle row, which can be a bit tricky to reach. It's worth noting that, for now, all these exceptions occur with the index fingers (both left and right, but more frequently with the right). This is positive because the dominant hand in most people is the right hand.

3.  Regarding the **'ch'** combination and its derivatives:

    Similarly, I have noticed that the 'ch' combination, even though it's not very common in the Spanish language, causes some discomfort because both letters use the same finger (the middle finger of the left hand), and the jump is made from the bottom row to the top row. This might be uncommon in the Spanish but it isn't in English, so it could be a problem for typing words like _'church'_, _'change'_, _'challenge'_, etc.

4.  Regarding the **'un'** combination and its derivatives:

    The _'un'_ combination presents a slight challenge as both letters are pressed with the right index finger and are stacked vertically. This happens in words like un, uno, una, etc. Nevertheless, given that the right index finger is typically the dominant one, this is unlikely to be a significant issue.

At the moment, these are the only combinations that have caused me problems. However, it is important to highlight that these problems are not significant, and this layout as it is already represents a significant improvement over QWERTY and a considerable improvement over Colemak (due to its 'ue' combination).
